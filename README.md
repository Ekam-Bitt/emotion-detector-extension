# Emotion Detector Extension

A Chrome extension that helps **content creators** quickly understand audience feedback on their posts and videos.

It analyzes comments from **YouTube, X (Twitter), and Reddit**, using the [Cardiff NLP `twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment`](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment) model from Hugging Face to classify text into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiment.
