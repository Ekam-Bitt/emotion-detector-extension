A privacy-focused browser extension that analyzes text content on web pages to detect emotional states and potential mental health indicators. Powered by a custom fine-tuned RoBERTa model.

## 📥 Getting Started

### 1. Get the Code

You need the full project code to run both the backend server and the extension.

- **Option A: Git (Recommended)**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ekam-Bitt/Detection-of-Mental-Disorders-Extension.git
  cd Detection-of-Mental-Disorders-Extension
  ```

- **Option B: No Git**
  1.  Go to the **[Latest Release](https://github.com/Ekam-Bitt/Detection-of-Mental-Disorders-Extension/releases/latest)**.
  2.  Download the **Source code (zip)** (at the bottom of the assets list).
  3.  Unzip the file and open the folder.

### 2. Start the Backend

The extension relies on a local backend server to process data.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

_Note: On the first run, it will download the ML model (~500MB) from Hugging Face._

### 3. Load the Extension

1.  Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2.  Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3.  Click **Load unpacked**.
4.  Select the `extension` folder from the project directory.

## 🚀 Features

- **Platform Support**: Specifically optimized for analyzing comments on **YouTube**, **Reddit**, and **X (Twitter)**.
- **Privacy First**: All analysis is done via a secure backend API; no data is stored permanently.
- **7 Emotion Categories**: Detects ADHD, Anxiety, Autism, BPD, Depression, PTSD, and Normal/Neutral states.
- **Visual Insights**: Displays a breakdown of detected emotions in a clean, easy-to-read chart.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend (Extension)**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Manifest V3)
- **Backend (API)**: Python, Flask, Gunicorn
- **ML Model**: RoBERTa (Fine-tuned), hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ekam28/emotion-detector)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose

## 🖥️ Usage

1.  Navigate to a **YouTube** video, **Reddit** thread, or **X (Twitter)** post with comments.
2.  Click the **Detection of Mental Disorders** icon in your browser toolbar.
3.  The extension will analyze the visible text and display a pie chart of the detected emotions.

## 🧠 Model Details

The core of this project is a custom fine-tuned RoBERTa model trained to classify text into the following categories:

| Label     | Condition                             |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `LABEL_0` | ADHD                                  |
| `LABEL_1` | Anxiety                               |
| `LABEL_2` | Autism                                |
| `LABEL_3` | BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) |
| `LABEL_4` | Depression                            |
| `LABEL_5` | PTSD                                  |
| `LABEL_6` | Normal                                |
